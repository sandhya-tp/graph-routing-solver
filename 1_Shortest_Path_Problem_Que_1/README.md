## üöö Shortest Path Finder
This project provides a C++ implementation for generating graphs, importing graph structures from JSON, and computing shortest paths using Dijkstra's and Floyd-Warshall algorithms. It also includes detailed logging of operations and performance statistics.
#### üß© Problem Statement

Develop a shortest-path module with the following capabilities:

- ‚úÖ Generate a **random connected graph** with `n` vertices and `m` edges (ensuring full connectivity).
- ‚úÖ Import/export graph structures via **JSON files**.
- ‚úÖ Implement shortest path algorithms for:
  - Shortest path **between any two vertices**
  - Shortest paths **to a single vertex** from all others
  - Shortest paths **from a single vertex** to all others
  - All-pairs shortest paths (Floyd‚ÄìWarshall)
- ‚úÖ Logging of calls to shortest path functions, performance metrics, and graph properties.

---

#### Features
- Random Connected Graph Generation
- Import/Export Graphs via JSON
- Shortest Path Algorithms
    - Single-source shortest paths using **Dijkstra's algorithm** (assumes **no negative edge weights**).
    - Shortest path between two specified nodes using **Dijkstra's algorithm**.
    - All-pairs shortest paths using **Floyd-Warshall algorithm** (assumes **no negative cycles**).

- Connectivity Checking using **BFS**
- Logging

#### Requirements 
C++17 or later
RapidJSON library (included in the project)
CMake (for building)

#### üõ†Ô∏è Build Instructions
Using g++ directly

```bash
g++ -std=c++17 -o graph_shortest_paths \
    main.cpp \
    Graph_Generator.cpp \
    Graph_json_processing.cpp \
    Graph_logger.cpp \
    Graph_Shortest_Paths.cpp \
    -I/path/to/rapidjson/include
```
Replace /path/to/rapidjson/include with the actual path to the RapidJSON header files.
Run the program
```bash
./graph_shortest_paths
```

#### Usage

The main program performs the following operations by default:
- Generates a random connected graph
- Loads a graph from JSON (exercise_baseline.json)
- Performs various graph algorithms:
- Dijkstra's algorithm from a source node to all nodes
- Dijkstra's algorithm between two specific nodes
- Floyd-Warshall all-pairs shortest paths
- Dijkstra's algorithm from all nodes to a target node
- Logs performance metrics to logs.txt

#### üóÇ Customizing Input
Graphs should be provided in JSON format with the following structure:

```json 
{
    "edges": [
        {
            "from": "a",
            "to": "b",
            "transit_time": weight
        },
        ...
    ]
}
```
#### üìä Output Files

The program generates several output files in the folder "Output":
- dijkstra_paths_from.json: Shortest paths from a source node
- dijkstra_paths_to.json: Shortest paths to a target node
- dijkstra_path_between_two_nodes.json: Shortest path between two specific nodes
- all_pairs_output.json: All-pairs shortest paths
- logs.txt: Performance metrics and operation logs
