## Shortest Path Problem ‚Äì Multi-Problem Project

This repository contains a collection of problems and solutions related to **shortest path algorithms** in graph-based networks. Each folder inside this repository represents an individual problem, complete with its own README, source code, data, and output.

## üìÅ Folder Structure

| Folder                                      | Description                                                  |
|---------------------------------------------|--------------------------------------------------------------|
| `1_Shortest_Path_Problem_Que_1/`            | Basic shortest path computation using Dijkstra and JSON logging |
| `2_Constrained_Shortest_Path_Bonus_Que_2/`  | Min-cost multi-commodity flow solver using Gurobi            |
| `3_Constrained_Shortest_Path_RL_Bonus_Que_3/`| Reinforcement learning and supervised ML-based SP solvers    |
| `generate_tree.py`                          | A script to generate tree view of the folders                   |
| `Offline Technical Challenge.docx`          | Problem statement                              |

Each folder includes its own `README.md` explaining the problem setup and solution approach.
